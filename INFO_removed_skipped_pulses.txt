INFO remove_skipped_pulses.m

This is a separate documentation file for the function remove_skipped_pulses.m
Removing pulse recordings which do not have corresponding angular data from
the electric motor positions can be tricky. The code might need to be changed
in the future to account for new unforeseen measurement data retrieval 
discrepancies and thus the code deserves an extended documentation. View this
file alongside the above mentioned function to understand what is going on.

The data_time parameter holds Linux machine time-stamps for each time the
the angle of emission is changed. The timeStamp_x parameter holds time-stamps
for each time a trigger pulse is received by the digitizers. There are more
angular time-stamps because sometimes the digitization card is not fast enough
to react.

To remove the extra pulses the difference between a trigger time-stamp (TTS)
value and angle change time-stamp (ATS). If this difference is larger than 1
the corresponding location of the ATS in the data_time array is stored in an
array called i_del.

If the laser shuts down after the last angle has been recorded, there will be 
extra TTS values which also have to be removed. Since the difference criterion 
presented above checks the difference a number of times equal to the number of 
TTS values the function will display an error if there TTS values further in
time than there are ATS values. This is why the while loop contains a "break"
command for when difference for all possible ATS values have been calculated.
The number of extra waveform time stamps is stored in the "rts" parameter and 
finally the waveforms with no corresponding angular time stamp values are removed.
